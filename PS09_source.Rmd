## Background{-}

First load the necessary packages:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(infer)
library(latex2exp)
```

For this Problem Set, you will work with some grade-point-average (GPA) data for college freshman. The following will read in the data:

```{r}
sat_gpa <- read_csv("https://rudeboybert.github.io/SDS220/static/PS/sat_gpa.csv")
```

Use the `View()` function **in the console** to take a look at the data in the viewer. Each row or case in this data frame is a student. The data includes the (binary) gender of each student; the math, verbal and total SAT scores for each student; the GPA of each student in high school (categorized as "low" or "high"); and the GPA of each student their first year of college on a numeric scale.

We will use hypothesis testing to answer the following questions:

*  Is there a difference in male and female freshman GPAs?
*  Is there a difference in total SAT score for students with a "low" and "high" high-school GPA?

Note, if you get stuck as you are working through this, it will be helpful to go back and read Chapter 10 in ModernDive.





# Gender Differences in First-Year GPA?

## Exploratory Data Analysis


1. Calculate the mean GPA score for each gender, using the `group_by` and `summarize` commands from the `dplyr` package.  Store the result in `avg_gpa_sex`.  What is the difference in sample mean GPA's? Make a guess: is this difference statistically significant?

```{r}
sat_gpa %>%
  group_by(sex) %>%
    summarise(gpa = mean(gpa_fy)) -> avg_gpa_sex

# Computing the difference
gpa_diff_sex <- round(avg_gpa_sex$gpa[1] - avg_gpa_sex$gpa[2], 3)

```

<div id="answer">
Considering that the `r gpa_diff_sex` difference in average gpa's by sex is generated from a dataset with `r nrow(sat_gpa)` observations, I believe it to be very slightly significant, statistically.


</div>

2. Generate a data visualization that displays the GPAs of the two groups. Be sure to include a title and label your axes. 

```{r}
ggplot(sat_gpa,aes(x=sex,y=gpa_fy, fill=sex)) +
  geom_boxplot() + 
  labs(title = "GPA by Gender",
       x = "Gender",
       y = "GPA" ) +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5), legend.position = "none", 
        panel.background = element_rect(fill = "#e3e3e3",
                                size = 0.5, linetype = "solid"),
  panel.grid.major = element_line(size = 0.5, linetype = 'solid',
                                colour = "#dbdbdb"),
  panel.grid.minor = element_line(size = 0.5, linetype = 'solid',
                                colour = "#e0e0de"))
  
```

***

## Stating a Null Hypothesis

We will now test the null hypothesis that there's no difference in population mean GPA between the genders at the population level. We can write this out in mathematical notation 

$$\begin{aligned} H_0:&\mu_{female} = \mu_{male} \\\ \mbox{vs }H_A:& \mu_{female} \neq \mu_{male} \end{aligned}$$

or expressed differently, that the difference is 0 or not:

$$\begin{aligned} H_0:&\mu_{female} - \mu_{male} = 0 \\\ \mbox{vs }H_A:& \mu_{female} - \mu_{male} \neq 0 \end{aligned}$$

## Testing the Hypothesis

Here's how we use infer to run this hypothesis test:

### Step 1: Calculate the Observed Difference{-} 

Note that the order we choose does not matter here (female then male)...but since we used `order = c("Female", "Male")` here, we should do the same in subsequent calculations!

```{r}
obs_diff_gpa_sex <- sat_gpa %>% 
  specify(gpa_fy ~ sex) %>% 
  calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c("Female", "Male")) %>% 
  pull()

obs_diff_gpa_sex
```

Note that this is the difference in the group means we calculated earlier!

```{r}
obs_diff_gpa_sex
2.544587 - 2.396066

```

### Step 2. Generate the Null Distribution of $\delta$ {-}

This step involves generating simulated values *as if* we lived in a world where there's no difference between the two groups. Going back to the idea of permutation, and tactile sampling, this is akin to shuffling the GPA scores between male and female labels (i.e. removing the structure to the data) just as we could have done with index cards. 

```{r}
gpas_in_null_world <- sat_gpa %>% 
  specify(gpa_fy ~ sex) %>% 
  hypothesize(null = "independence") %>% 
  generate(reps = 2000)
```



3. What was the size of the "shuffled" (permuted) sample in each run?

<div id="answer">
Each sample was of size `r nrow(sat_gpa)`.

</div> 

***

4. How many times did we do a different "shuffle" (permute) here to the sample? How many rows are in the `gpas_in_null_world` data frame?

```{r}
q4 <- nrow(gpas_in_null_world) / nrow(sat_gpa)

```


<div id="answer">
`r q4` permutations were applied.


</div> 

***

### Step 3. Calculate the Differences Between Male and Females Under the Null Hypothesis{-}

The following calculates the differences in mean GPA for males and females for "shuffled" (permuted) data. 

```{r}
gpa_diff_under_null <- gpas_in_null_world %>% 
  calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c("Female", "Male")) 

gpa_diff_under_null %>% 
  slice(1:5)
```



5. How many rows are in this data frame? Why?

<div id="answer">
There are `r nrow(gpa_diff_under_null)` rows because the output is grouped by a null distribution's `rep` variable when piped into infer's `calculate()` function.


</div> 

***

### Step 4. Visualize how the Observed Difference Compares to the Null Distribution of $\delta$ {-}

The following plots the $\delta$ values we calculated for each of the different "shuffled" replicates. This is the null distribution of $\delta$. The red line shows the observed difference between male and female scores in the data from step 1. 

```{r}
gpa_diff_under_null %>% 
  visualize() +
  labs(x = "Difference in mean GPA for males and females", y = "Count",
       title = "Null distribution of differences in male and female GPAs",
      subtitle = "Actual difference observed in the data is marked in red") + 
  shade_p_value(obs_stat = obs_diff_gpa_sex, direction = "two-sided") +
  theme_bw()
```

**Note that zero is the center of this null distribution.** The null hypothesis is that there is no difference between males and females in GPA score. In the permutations, zero was the most common value, because all structure was removed from the data...GPA values were sorted into male and female **at random**. Values as large as ~ 0.1 and -0.1 occurred, but much less frequently, because they are just not as likely when structure is removed from the data.  


### Step 5: Calculate a p-value{-}

```{r}
gpa_diff_under_null %>% 
  get_pvalue(obs_stat = obs_diff_gpa_sex, direction = "both") %>%   pull() -> pvalue
pvalue
```

This result indicates that there is a `r pvalue` chance (very low) that we would see a difference of `r obs_diff_gpa_sex` in GPA scores between males and females (or a bigger difference) if in fact there was truly no difference between the sexes in GPA scores at the population level.



6. Fill in the blanks below to write up the results & conclusions for this test:

<div id="answer">

The mean GPA scores for females in our sample ($\bar{x}$ = `r round(avg_gpa_sex$gpa[1],3)`) was greater than that of males ($\bar{x}$ = `r round(avg_gpa_sex$gpa[2],3)`). This difference __was__ statistically significant at  $\alpha = 0.05$, (p = `r pvalue`).  Given this, I __would__ reject the Null hypothesis and conclude that females have higher GPAs than males at the population level.

</div> 



***

### Step 6: Calculate a Confidence Interval for the Difference{-}

The following will allow us to calculate a 95% bootstrap percentile confidence interval for the difference between mean GPA scores for females and males. 

```{r}
ci_diff_gpa_means <- sat_gpa %>% 
  specify(gpa_fy ~ sex) %>%
  generate(reps = 2000) %>% 
  calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c("Female", "Male")) %>% 
  get_ci(level = 0.95, type = "percentile")
ci_diff_gpa_means
```

## Complete all the Above Tasks with a t-test{-}

Note that all the above steps can be done with one line of code **if a slew of assumptions** like normality and equal variance of the groups are met. 

```{r}
t.test(gpa_fy ~ sex, var.equal = TRUE, data = sat_gpa)
```

***



# Relationship Between High-School & First-Year GPA?

For this analysis `sat_total` is the outcome variable, and `gpa_hs` is the predictor variable, with two levels "low" and "high". 

## Exploratory Data Analysis

We can first calculate the mean total SAT score for each group (i.e students with a low and high GPA), using the `group_by` and `summarize` commands from the `dplyr` package. 

```{r}
avg_sat_gpa <- sat_gpa %>% 
  group_by(gpa_hs) %>% 
  summarize(sat_total = mean(sat_total))

avg_sat_gpa
```

We will next generate a data visualization that displays the total SAT scores of the two groups. Be sure to include a title and label your axes. 

```{r}
ggplot(sat_gpa, aes(x = gpa_hs, y = sat_total)) + 
  geom_boxplot(fill = "darkgreen") + 
  labs(title = "SAT scores based on high school GPA scores", 
       x = "GPA ranking", y = "SAT score") + 
  theme_bw() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

## Stating a Null Hypothesis


7.  State the null hypothesis that you are testing (using either words or symbols)

<div id="answer">
The difference in high school GPA rankings has no effect on SAT scores.


</div> 

***

## Testing the Null Hypothesis


Calculate the observed difference between the mean total SAT scores of the low and high GPA high-school students. Store the result in an object named `obs_diff_sat_hs_gpa`

```{r}
(obs_diff_sat_hs_gpa <- sat_gpa %>% 
  specify(sat_total ~ gpa_hs) %>% 
  calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c("high", "low")) %>%
   pull())

```

***

8.  Generate the null distribution of $\delta$. Here you need to generate simulated values *as if* we lived in a world where there's no difference in SAT scores between high school students with low and high GPAs.  Use 2000 replications to generate the null distribution. 

```{r}
sat_in_null_world <- sat_gpa %>% 
  specify(sat_total ~ gpa_hs) %>% 
  hypothesize(null = "independence") %>% 
  generate(reps = 2000, type = "permute")
  
```

***

9.  Calculate the differences in mean SAT scores between students with high and low GPA scores under the null hypothesis. Note...you should use whatever order you chose in 7. Store your results in an object named `sat_diff_under_null`. 

```{r}
(sat_diff_under_null <- sat_in_null_world %>% 
  calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c("high", "low"))) %>%
  slice(1:5)
```

***

10. Visualize how the observed difference compares to the null distribution of $\delta$. Generate a histogram of the null distribution, with a vertical red line showing the observed difference in SAT scores between high school students with a high and low GPA. 


```{r}
label_string <- data.frame(Ref = c("Observed Difference"),
                           val = c(obs_diff_sat_hs_gpa))
ggplot(sat_diff_under_null, aes(x=stat)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = .2, color = "black", fill = "PowderBlue") +
  geom_vline(mapping = aes(xintercept = val,
                           colour = Ref),
             data = label_string) +
  geom_text(mapping = aes(x = val + 0.1,
                          y = 0,
                          label = Ref,
                          hjust = 1.8,
                          vjust = 0,
                          angle = -90),
                          data = label_string) +
  labs(title = TeX("$\\delta_{null\\,distribution}$ , $\\delta_{observed}$"), 
       x = "Difference in SAT score by High vs. Low HS GPA's",
       y = "Density" ) +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5), legend.position = "none", 
        panel.background = element_rect(fill = "#e3e3e3",
                                size = 0.5, linetype = "solid"),
  panel.grid.major = element_line(size = 0.5, linetype = 'solid',
                                colour = "#dbdbdb"),
  panel.grid.minor = element_line(size = 0.5, linetype = 'solid',
                                colour = "#e0e0de")) 
```


11. Calculate the p-value.

```{r}
sat_diff_under_null %>% 
  get_pvalue(obs_stat = obs_diff_sat_hs_gpa, direction = "both") %>% pull() -> pvalue_sat
pvalue_sat
```

<div id="answer">
This result indicates that there is a < 0.001 chance we would see a difference of `r obs_diff_sat_hs_gpa` in SAT scores between students with differing high school GPA's (high/low) if in fact there was truly no difference between those with `"high"` high school GPA's vs. those with `"low"` high school GPA's in SAT scores at the population level.



</div> 

***

12. Write up the results & conclusions for this hypothesis test. Note, p-values less than 0.001 are often reported as p < 0.001. 

<div id="answer">
The mean SAT scores for students with high GPA's in our sample ($\bar{x}$ =  `r round(avg_sat_gpa$sat_total[1],3)`) was greater than those with low GPA rankings (($\bar{x}$ =  `r round(avg_sat_gpa$sat_total[2],3)`). This difference __was__ statistically significant at $\alpha = 0.05$, (p < 0.001). Given this, I __would__ reject the Null hypothesis and conclude that those with `"high"` high school GPA's have higher SAT scores than those with `"low"` high school GPA's at the population level.




</div> 

***

13. Compute a 95% bootstrap percentile confidence interval for the difference in total SAT scores for students with high and low high-school GPA scores. Note...you should use whatever order you chose for your null hypothesis...i.e. `order = c("low", "high")` or `order = c("high", "low")`.  Provide a basic interpretation of your computed interval.

```{r}
(ci_diff_sat_means <- sat_gpa %>% 
  specify(sat_total ~ gpa_hs) %>%
  generate(reps = 2000) %>% 
  calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c("high", "low")) %>% 
  get_ci(level = 0.95, type = "percentile"))
```

<div id="answer">
According to `ci_diff_sat_means` we can be 95% confident that the true mean difference in SAT scores between students with `"high"` and `"low"` high school GPA's ($\mu_\delta$) is between `r ci_diff_sat_means$lower_ci[1]` and `r ci_diff_sat_means$upper_ci[1]`. 



</div> 

***

14. Use a t-test to test the null hypothesis that average total SAT scores do not differ between students with high and low high school GPA scores at the population level.

```{r}
t.test(sat_total ~ gpa_hs, var.equal = TRUE, data = sat_gpa)
```
